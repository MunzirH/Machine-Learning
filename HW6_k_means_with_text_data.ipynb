    "# Homework 6 - Implementing k-means with Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Portion on EdStem and Concept on Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement the k-means algorithm in the specific setting of clustering text documents, but the algorithm is general to any setting. When properly executed, clustering uncovers valuable insights from a set of unlabeled documents. The assignment uses the `numpy` library for manipulating the data arrays. See [this tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) for more information on numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cluster Wikipedia documents using k-means\n",
    "* Explore the role of random initialization on the quality of the clustering\n",
    "* Explore how results differ after changing the number of clusters\n",
    "* Evaluate clustering, both quantitatively and qualitatively\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the cells provided marked `TODO` with code to answer the questions. **Unless otherwise noted, every answer you submit should have code that clearly shows the answer in the output.** Answers submitted that do not have associated code that shows the answer may not be accepted for credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure to restart the kernel and run all cells** (especially before turning it in) to make sure your code runs correctly. Answer the questions on Gradescope and make sure to download this file once you've finished the assignment and upload it to Canvas as well.\n",

Track heterogeneity versus K and look for the \"elbow\" of the curve where the heterogeneity decrease rapidly before this value of K, but then only gradually for larger values of K.  This naturally trades off between trying to minimize heterogeneity, but reduce model complexity.  In the heterogeneity versus K plot made above, we did not yet really see a flattening out of the heterogeneity, which might indicate that indeed K=100 is \"reasonable\" and we only see real overfitting for larger values of K (which are even harder to visualize using the methods we attempted above.)"
